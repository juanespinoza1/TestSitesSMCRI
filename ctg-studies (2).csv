NCT04549792,An Open-Label and Long-Term Extension Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Ustekinumab in the Treatment of Patients With Ichthyoses,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04549792,COMPLETED,"The ichthyoses are a group of lifelong genetic disorders that share characteristics of generalized skin thickening, scaling and underlying cutaneous inflammation. The vast majority are orphan disorders and are associated with extremely poor quality of life related to social ostracism from altered appearance, associated itchiness and discomfort, and functional limitations from the skin disease. Among the more common ""orphan"" forms of ichthyosis are autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI; includes lamellar ichthyosis/LI and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma/CIE), Netherton syndrome (NS) and epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI). However, there are dozens of other syndromic and non-syndromic ichthyotic disorders as well. Therapy is time-consuming for patients or parents and is supportive, focusing on clearance of the scaling. There are no therapies based on our growing understanding of what causes the disease. We have recently found marked elevations in Th17/IL-23 pathway cytokines and chemokines in the skin of individuals with ichthyosis, most similar to the inflammatory pattern of psoriasis. While the significance of the high expression of Th17/IL-23 pathway genes across all forms of ichthyosis studied to date is unknown, the high expression of genes of the Th17/IL-23 pathway in psoriasis is thought to be causative for the disease manifestations. We propose that IL-12/IL-23 -targeting therapeutics will safely suppress the inflammation and possibly the other features of ichthyosis, improving quality of life. As a proof-of-concept study, we propose to treat children (6 years of age and higher) and adults with ichthyotic disorders with ustekinumab in an open-label trial to serially assess clinical response to and safety of ustekinumab for this group of disorders.",Ichthyosis,DRUG: Ustekinumab,Northwestern University,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC",OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Northwestern University/Lurie Children's Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States"

NCT00179790,Reduced Intensity Transplant Using Extracorporeal Photopheresis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00179790,COMPLETED,"Stem cell transplantation may be used to cure childhood cancers, and other diseases. Traditionally, stem cell transplants use high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. This regimen may cause significant problems after transplant such as infertility, infection, and graft versus host disease (GVHD).

Reduced intensity transplant (RIT) uses medications which weaken the immune system, allowing donor cells to take over. The goal of a RIT is to reduce the risk for complications after transplant. Usually medication is used to weaken the immune system, but there are other options such as extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) that may be less toxic.

ECP is currently used for the treatment of GVHD and certain lymphomas. ECP uses a machine that filters white blood cells from the blood, treats them with ultraviolet (UV) light, and then gives all the cells back to the patient. The patient's immune system becomes weaker, allowing the donor cells to replace those of the patient. Studies involving the use of ECP for conditioning have shown fewer side effects than the use of medications.

The primary purpose of this clinical research trial is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ECP as part of a preparative regimen for RIT in children and young adults.",Leukemia|Cancer,PROCEDURE: Extracorporeal Photopheresis,Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,Mallinckrodt,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60625, United States"

We also want to learn about the effects, if any, these drugs have on children and young adults with brain tumors.

We are asking people to be in this research study who have been diagnosed with a high grade glioma, their tumor has been screened for the Rb1 protein, and they have recently finished radiation therapy. If a patient has DIPG or a Bi-thalamic high grade glioma, they do not need to have the tumor tissue screened for the Rb1 protein, but do need to have finished radiation therapy.

Tumor cells grow and divide quickly. In normal cells, there are proteins that control how fast cells grow but in cancer cells these proteins no longer work correctly making tumor cells grow quickly. Both study drugs work in different ways to slow down the growth of tumor cells. The researchers think that if the study drugs are given together soon after radiation therapy, it may help improve the effect of the radiation in stopping or slowing down tumor growth.

The study drugs, ribociclib and everolimus, have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ribociclib is approved to treat adults with breast cancer and everolimus is approved for use in adults and children who have other types of cancers. The combination of ribociclib and everolimus has not been tested in children or in people with brain tumors and is considered investigational.

The goals of this study are:

* Find the safest dose of ribociclib and everolimus that can be given together after radiation.
* Learn the side effects (both good and bad) the study drugs have on the body and tumor.
* Measure the levels of study drug in the blood over time.

NCT02315898,Inhaled Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Acute Plastic Bronchitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02315898,COMPLETED,"Plastic bronchitis (PB) is a rare, most often pediatric disease characterized by the formation of obstructive airway casts primarily composed of fibrin. There is presently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for PB, but acute exacerbations of the illness are often treated with inhaled tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). To date, this is done somewhat anecdotally because there has been no safety or efficacy testing of this treatment. In addition, there is presently no reliable surrogate marker of adverse drug events. Nevertheless, in the absence of inhaled tPA treatment, PB-induced respiratory distress can be severe, often warranting urgent or emergent bronchoscopy for cast removal, or can sometimes result in respiratory failure. As such there is a significant unmet need for safety and efficacy testing of inhaled tPA and for biomarkers of drug response.

Objectives and Endpoints: The objectives of this protocol are to: 1) test the safety and efficacy of an inhaled tPA regimen in children with PB; and 2) identify potential candidate biomarkers of inhaled tPA drug response. Safety endpoints will consist of the development of new, active bleeding that is systemic and/or pulmonary and/or new hematuria (defined as gross hematuria). Secondary endpoints of efficacy will also be measured (e.g., frequency of cast production). Urine and blood will also be collected for the development of potential biomarkers of inhaled tPA drug response.

NCT05754333,A Study to Find Out if ASP5354 Can Clearly Help Show the Ureter During Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05754333,COMPLETED,"The ureter is the tube that carries urine from the kidneys to the bladder. It is difficult for surgeons to see the ureter during abdominal surgery. This could lead to injuring the ureter which, although rare, could be serious.

This study is about a potential new medical dye, called ASP5354. This dye is injected into the person at the start of surgery and is detected in the ureter. This is done by an imaging machine which has an option called near infrared fluorescence, or NIR-F. Together they show live images of specific parts of the body. In this study, ASP5354 is used with an imaging machine with a NIR-F option to show live images of the ureter during surgery.

People with kidneys that work properly and those with kidney problems can take part. The main aim of the study is to find out how clearly the ureter can be seen with ASP5354 during surgery in adults whose kidneys work properly or who have mild kidney problems. To do this, the surgeons will inject ASP5354 into the person having surgery. Then, the surgeons will compare images of the ureter with an imaging machine using normal white light and with the NIR-F option. Imaging using normal white light is the standard way surgeons see the ureter during surgery.

People 12 years or older who were going to have certain abdominal surgeries may be able to take part.

Everyone taking part will receive ASP5354 during surgery, but how the imaging is done will depend on which group they are in. Before surgery, the adults taking part whose kidneys work properly or who have mild kidney problems will be assigned into 1 of 2 groups by chance alone. Images of the ureter will be checked in 1 group using normal white light and the other group using normal white light and NIR-F. People 18 years and older with more severe kidney problems and all people under 18 years old will not be assigned to 1 of 2 groups: all images of the ureter will be checked using normal white light and NIR-F.

At the start of surgery, the surgeon will inject ASP5354 into the person having surgery, then will start recording a video. Then, after 30 minutes, the surgeon will record how well the ureter can be seen. This will be done by either using normal white light, or normal white light and NIR-F, depending which group each person having surgery is assigned to. For the group to be checked with normal white light and NIR-F, the surgeon will do this every 30 minutes until the end of surgery. For the group to be checked with normal white light only, the surgeon will only do this after the first 30 minutes.

During the study, people will visit the study hospital 3 times. The first visit is to check if they can take part in the study. People will be asked about their medical history, have a medical examination, and their vital signs checked (blood pressure and pulse rate). Also, they will have some blood and urine tests. For women and girls this may include a pregnancy test. People will have their surgery at the second visit. This will be within 28 days of their first visit. This includes having some blood and urine tests before, during, and after surgery. Also, they will have a medical examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check their heart rhythm, and have their vital signs checked. After surgery, people will return to the clinic 15 days later for a final check-up. They will be asked if they have had any medical problems.

This study will focus on children under the age of 3 who were previously treated with the gene therapy onasemnogene abeparvovec but are still facing health challenges related to their disease.

The main goal of the study is to learn about the effect nusinersen has on muscle and movement ability (motor function). The main question researchers want to answer is:

- What score do participants have on the HINE Section 2 Motor Milestones test after treatment?

The Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) Section 2 Motor Milestones is an assessment that tests movements in different positions. This includes grasping, kicking, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking.

Researchers will use a group of tests to study body movements, reflexes, balance, and coordination. They will also record if participants need help with breathing.

Researchers will also learn more about the safety of nusinersen. They will check participants for adverse events and changes in vital signs, heart tests, and laboratory tests including blood and urine tests.

The study will be done as follows:

* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study.
* Each participant will receive 4 initial doses of 12 mg of nusinersen on Days 1, 15, 29, and 64 of the Treatment Period. Then, they will receive 12 mg doses once every 4 months.
* The total number of doses of nusinersen will be 9.
* Nusinersen will be given through a lumbar puncture, which involves injecting the drug into the fluid around the spinal cord in the lower back.
* The treatment period will last for up to 95 weeks (close to 2 years).
* There will be a follow-up safety period that lasts about 4 months.
* In total, participants will have up to 14 study visits. Participants will stay in the study for up to 115 weeks.","Muscular Atrophy, Spinal",DRUG: Nusinersen,Biogen,,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Arkansas Children's Hospital Research Institute, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72202, United States|Stanford Neuromuscular Research, Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Ann & Robert H.

We will conduct a multi-center double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine whether hearing-impaired infants with asymptomatic cCMV have better hearing and language outcomes if they receive valganciclovir antiviral treatment. We will also determine the safety of antiviral valganciclovir therapy for asymptomatic cCMV-infected hearing impaired infants. This study will be unique in that the cohort enrolled will only include hearing-impaired infants with asymptomatic cCMV.

Primary Objective: To determine if treatment of cCMV-infected hearing impaired infants with isolated hearing loss with the antiviral drug valganciclovir reduces the mean slope of total hearing thresholds over the 20 months after randomization compared to untreated cCMV-infected infants with isolated hearing loss.

Main Secondary Objectives:

1. To determine if valganciclovir treatment improves the following outcomes when compared to the control group:

   1. The slope of best ear hearing thresholds over the 20 months after randomization.
   2. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) percentile score for words produced at 20 months of age.

NCT05353647,"A Gene Transfer Study Inducing Fetal Hemoglobin in Sickle Cell Disease (GRASP, BMT CTN 2001)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05353647,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"A promising approach for the treatment of genetic diseases is called gene therapy. Gene therapy is a relatively new field of medicine in which genetic material (mostly DNA) in the patient is changed to treat his or her own disease. In gene therapy, we introduce new genetic material in order to fix or replace the patient's disease gene, with the goal of curing the disease. The procedure is similar to a bone marrow transplant, in that the patient's malfunctioning blood stem cells are reduced or eliminated using chemotherapy, but it is different because instead of using a different person's (donor) blood stem cells for the transplant, the patient's own blood stem cells are given back after the new genetic material has been introduced into those cells. This approach has the advantage of eliminating any risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD), reducing the risk of graft rejection, and may also allow less chemotherapy to be utilized for the conditioning portion of the transplant procedure. To introduce new genetic material into the patient's own blood stem cells we use a modified version of a virus (called a 'vector') that efficiently inserts the ""correcting"" genetic material into the cells. The vector is a specialized biological medicine that has been formulated for use in human beings.

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a healthy, non-sickling kind of hemoglobin. The investigators have discovered a gene that is very important in controlling the amount of HbF. Decreasing the expression of this gene in sickle cell patients could increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin while simultaneously reducing the amount of sickle hemoglobin in their blood, specifically the amount in red blood cells where sickle hemoglobin causes damage to the cell, and therefore potentially cure or significantly improve the condition. The gene we are targeting for change in this study that controls the level of fetal hemoglobin is called BCL11A.

In summary, the advantages of a gene therapy approach include: 1) it can be used even if the patient does not have a matched donor available; 2) it may allow a reduction in the amount of chemotherapy required to prepare the patient for the transplant; and 3) it will avoid certain strong medicines often required to prevent and treat GVHD and rejection. Our lab studies with normal mice, mice that have a form of SCD, and with cells from the bone marrow of SCD patients who have donated bone marrow for research purposes show this approach is very effective in reducing the amount of sickle hemoglobin in red cells. Our pilot trial testing this approach in 10 patients with SCD has shown that the treatment has not caused any unexpected safety problems, and that it increases HbF within the red blood cells. Our goal is to continue to test whether this approach is safe, and whether using gene therapy to change the expression of BCL11A will lead to decreased episodes of vaso-occlusive crisis pain in people with SCD.",Sickle Cell Disease,BIOLOGICAL: Autologous CD34+ HSC cells transduced with the lentiviral vector containing a shRNA targeting BCL11a,David Williams,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)|California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)|bluebird bio|Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network",OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, 90027, United States|UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, Oakland, California, 94609, United States|UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|Children&#39;s Healthcare of Atlanta/Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Lurie Children&#39;s Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Boston Children&#39;s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States"

NCT03199469,A Study of AT132 in Young Children With X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy (XLMTM),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03199469,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare and serious condition present at birth where the muscles do not work properly. There are currently no therapies for this serious condition.

The protein myotubularin is needed for muscle development and movement. A gene called MTM1 tells the body to make myotubularin. XLMTM is caused by changes, or mutations, in the MTM1 gene. Changes in the MTM1 gene causes low levels of myotubularin to be made, so the muscles do not work properly. XLMTM may also affect the liver, and in some cases, this can be dangerous and threaten the patient´s life.

Gene therapy is a way of getting a healthy copy of a gene into the body. This allows the body's cells to make a normal protein that may reduce disease symptoms. AT132 is a gene therapy that gets a healthy MTM1 gene into the body to help improve muscle development and function in young children with the disease. AT132 does not treat liver disease, and because of the way the treatment works, it may make liver problems worse.

AT132 was the gene therapy treatment given to children who participated in this study and is not available to the public. In this study, AT132 was given to children for the first time. Due to the occurrence of severe complications and fatalities associated with administration of AT132, the study has been stopped and no further participants will be enrolled.

The main aim of the study is to check how long young children need machines to support breathing (ventilation support) after AT132.

Due to the occurrence of severe complications and fatalities associated with administration of AT132, the study has been stopped and no further participants will be enrolled. This study included children with XLMTM under 5 years old who had breathing problems caused by XLMTM. They couldn't take part if they were born prematurely, recently had surgery, had liver disease or other condition or disease the study doctor thought was medically important. The study did enroll participants with medically significant liver disease.

This is an open-label study. This means that young children and their caregivers, and clinic staff know that young children received AT132. This study was designed with 2 parts and is now in a long-term follow-up phase to collect information on the safety and improvements in muscle function in the children who received AT132.

In Part 1, small groups of young children were given different doses of AT132, with one group receiving a lower dose and one group receiving a higher dose of AT132. The purpose of giving the two doses was to determine which dose was best for treating the muscle disease. After receiving AT132, a medical panel of experts reviewed each child for safety and for how their muscles responded. AT132 did not demonstrate appropriate safety at either dose. Administration of AT132 was stopped. Children who received AT132 are being monitored for 10 years for safety and to understand how their muscles function over time.",X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy,GENETIC: Resamirigene bilparvovec,Astellas Gene Therapies,,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/NIH Porter, Bethesda, Maryland, 208892, United States|Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, M5G0A4, Canada|Hopital Armad Trousseau, Paris, 75012, France|Kinderklinik und Kinderpoliklinik im Dr. Von Haunerschen Kinderspital Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, München, 80337, Germany"

NCT01733316,"Open-Label, Safety and Superior Effectiveness Study of Cysteamine Bitartrate Delayed-Release Capsules (RP103) in Cystinosis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01733316,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to gather information about the effectiveness (how well it works to treat cystinosis) and safety of a new form of cysteamine bitartrate called RP103, compared to the already-approved drug cystinosis patients are taking called Cystagon®.

In cystinosis, the body builds up cystine. When taken regularly, the active ingredient of Cystagon® (cysteamine bitartrate) reduces cystine in the body. RP103 has the same active ingredient as Cystagon® and is designed to reduce cystine in a similar way that Cystagon® does. To decide if RP103 is better than Cystagon®, the study will look at two types of blood tests. One test is pharmacodynamics (PD), which measures the amount of white blood cell (WBC) cystine after taking study drug. WBC cystine is a laboratory test used to find out if cysteamine bitartrate is reducing cystine levels in the body. The second test is pharmacokinetics (PK), which measures the amount of cysteamine in the blood after taking the drug.

RP103 is different from Cystagon®: Instead of the cysteamine bitartrate being absorbed from the stomach, RP103 is designed to be absorbed from the small intestine. This may make the effects of the drug last longer, so that it can be taken twice a day instead of four times a day like Cystagon®.

Some cystinosis patients have bad breath (halitosis) when they take Cystagon®. Study participants who experience bad breath with Cystagon® will be asked if they would like to participate in an optional ""halitosis substudy"" to investigate this issue by collecting some extra PK blood samples.",Cystinosis,DRUG: RP103|DRUG: Cystagon®,Amgen,,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) Research Institute, San Francisco, California, 94115, United States|Stanford University Medical School, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Emory Children's Center, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Ann & Robert H.

This study is an extension study and will enroll only those participants who have completed treatment in the parent study, 232SM203.

The main goal of the study is to learn about the long-term safety of nusinersen. The main questions researchers want to answer are:

* How many participants have adverse events and serious adverse events during the study?
* How do the results of electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and laboratory tests including blood and urine tests change after treatment?
* How many participants have a low platelet count after treatment?
* How many participants had a change in the time it took for their heart to recharge between beats after treatment?
* How does each participant's height and other measures of growth change after treatment?
* How much do the results of neurological exams that check movement, reflexes, and brain function change after treatment?

Researchers will also learn about the effect of nusinersen on mobility using various tests. They will study body movements, reflexes, balance, and coordination. They will also record if participants need help with breathing.

The 232SM302 study will be done as follows:

* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study.
* Participants will receive their 1st dose of nusinersen in this study about 4 months after their final dose in the parent study.
* Each participant will receive nusinersen once every 4 months during the treatment period.
* Nusinersen will be given through a lumbar puncture, which involves injecting the drug into the fluid around the spinal cord in the lower back.
* The treatment period will last for up to 64 months (1921 days).
* There will be a follow-up safety period that lasts from 4 to 8 weeks.
* In total, participants will have up to 19 study visits. Participants will stay in the study for close to 6 years.","Muscular Atrophy, Spinal",DRUG: Nusinersen,Biogen,,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Stanford University Medical Center, Sacramento, California, 94304, United States|Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Ann & Robert H.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

NCT05067790,A Study to Learn About the Effect of Higher Doses of Nusinersen (BIIB058) Given as Injections to Participants With Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Who Were Previously Treated With Risdiplam (ASCEND),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05067790,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"In this study, researchers will learn more about the use of a higher dose of nusinersen (BIIB058) in participants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This study will focus on teenagers and adults who are unable to walk on their own and who have previously taken another drug for SMA called risdiplam.

The main goal of this study is to learn about the effect of high dose (HD) nusinersen on muscle and movement ability (motor function) in SMA. The main question that researchers want to answer is:

- How do the scores of a movement test called the Revised Upper Limb Module change from the start of treatment?

The Revised Upper Limb Module is a test used to measure a participant's ability to do specific tasks that involve their shoulders, arms, wrist, elbows, and hands. It measures the changes in their abilities over time.

Researchers will also learn more about the safety of HD nusinersen. They will check participants for adverse events and changes in vital signs, heart tests, and laboratory tests including blood and urine tests.

The study will be done as follows:

* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study.
* After screening, participants will enter the Core Treatment period.
* At the start of the Core Treatment period, they will receive 2 ""loading"" doses of nusinersen. These are 50 mg doses of nusinersen given 2 weeks apart.
* Afterwards, they will continue to receive ""maintenance"" doses of nusinersen once every 4 months. These doses will be 28 mg.
* The Core Treatment period will last about 2 years, with a follow-up visit 4 months after the last dose.
* Participants who complete the Core Treatment period will have the option to continue receiving 28 mg of nusinersen in the Long-Term Extension (LTE) period for about 2 years. There will also be a follow-up visit 4 months after the last dose.
* Nusinersen will be given through a lumbar puncture, which involves injecting the drug into the fluid around the spinal cord in the lower back.

Three intravenous (IV) dose levels will be investigated in a within subject dose escalating fashion. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 sequence groups for approximately 96 weeks (2 periods of 48 weeks each). In period 1, two of the sequence groups will receive PF-06252616 and one sequence group will receive placebo. In period 2, the placebo group will switch to PF-06252616 and the two remaining sequence groups will either receive placebo or PF-06252616. Efficacy will be based on an observed mean change from baseline on function (4 stair climb) of PF-06252616 as compared to the placebo at the end of period 1. Period 2 provides an opportunity to evaluate PK. Subjects will receive monthly IV infused doses of either PF-06252616 or placebo and will undergo safety evaluations (Laboratory, cardiac monitoring, physical exams, x-ray, MRI), functional evaluations (pulmonary function testing, 4 stair climb, range of motion, strength testing, Northstar Ambulatory Assessment, upper limb functional testing and the six minute walk test), pharmacokinetic testing and pharmacodynamic testing to evaluate changes in muscle volume (MRI).",Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,BIOLOGICAL: PF-06252616|DRUG: Placebo,Pfizer,,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Ronald Reagan UCLA Pharmacy, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|UCLA (David Geffen School of Medicine), Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|University of California, Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Shriners Hospitals for Children - Tampa, Tampa, Florida, 33612, United States|Ann & Robert H.

The main aim of the study is to check for side effects from treatment with BAX855. This includes the buildup of antibodies against FVIII which may stop BAX855 from working properly. Another aim is to learn how well BAX855 controls bleeding.

In this study, the children can receive BAX855 either as preventative treatment (prophylaxis), or as needed to treat bleeding (on-demand).

Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to kill tumor cells or stop them from growing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy together with panitumumab and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving panitumumab together with docetaxel, cisplatin, radiation therapy, and surgery works in treating patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced esophageal cancer or cancer of the gastroesophageal junction.",Adenocarcinoma of the Gastroesophageal Junction|Esophageal Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: panitumumab|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: docetaxel|PROCEDURE: neoadjuvant therapy|PROCEDURE: therapeutic conventional surgery|RADIATION: radiation therapy,Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Amgen,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Curtis and Elizabeth Anderson Cancer Institute at Memorial Health University Medical Center, Savannah, Georgia, 31403-3089, United States|Robert H.

NCT04064060,A Study to Evaluate Long-term Safety in Participants Who Have Participated in Other Luspatercept (ACE-536) Clinical Trials,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04064060,RECRUITING,"A Phase 3b, open-label, single-arm, rollover study to evaluate the long-term safety of luspatercept, to the following participants:

* Participants receiving luspatercept on a parent protocol at the time of their transition to the rollover study, who tolerate the protocol-prescribed regimen in the parent trial and, in the opinion of the investigator, may derive clinical benefit from continuing treatment with luspatercept
* Participants in the follow-up phase previously treated with luspatercept or placebo in the parent protocol will continue into long-term post-treatment follow-up in the rollover study until the follow-up commitments are met
* The study design is divided into the Transition Phase, Treatment Phase and Follow-up Phase. Participants will enter transition phase and depending on their background will enter either the treatment phase or the Long-term Post-treatment Follow-up (LTPTFU) phase
* Transition Phase is defined as one Enrollment visit
* Treatment Phase: For participants in luspatercept treatment the dose and schedule of luspatercept in this study will be the same as the last dose and schedule in the parent luspatercept study. This does not apply to participants that are in long-term follow-up from the parent protocol
* Follow-up Phase includes:

  - 42 Day Safety Follow-up Visit
* During the Safety Follow up, the participants will be followed for 42 days after the last dose of luspatercept, for the assessment of safety-related parameters and adverse event (AE) reporting

  - Long-term Post-treatment Follow-up (LTPTFU) Phase
* Participants will be followed for overall survival every 6 months for at least 5 years from first dose of luspatercept in the parent protocol, or 3 years of post-treatment from last dose, whichever occurs later, or until death, withdrawal of consent, study termination, or until a subject is lost to follow-up. Participants will also be monitored for progression to AML or any malignancies/pre-malignancies. New anticancer or disease related therapies should be collected at the same time schedule

Participants transitioning from a parent luspatercept study in post-treatment follow-up (safety or LTPTFU) will continue from the same equivalent point in this rollover study.

The ACE-536-LTFU-001 rollover study will be terminated, and relevant participants will discontinue from the study when all participants fulfill 5 years on the study, including treatment and follow-up.",Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)|Beta-thalassemia|Myeloproliferative Neoplasm(MPN)-Associated Myelofibrosis,DRUG: Luspatercept,Celgene,,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Childrens Hospital Los Angeles RHU, Los Angeles, California, 90027-6062, United States|Local Institution - 971, Oakland, California, 94609, United States|Local Institution - 978, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Local Institution - 975, Tampa, Florida, 33612, United States|Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Local Institution - 961, Detroit, Michigan, 48201, United States|Local Institution - 969, New York, New York, 10065, United States|Local Institution - 967, Cleveland, Ohio, 44195, United States|Local Institution - 972, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|Vanderbilt - Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232-5505, United States|The University of Texas - MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Local Institution - 100, South Brisbane, Queensland, 4101, Australia|Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, 5000, Australia|Local Institution - 102, Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia|Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, 2050, Australia|Local Institution - 182, Brasschaat, 2930, Belgium|Local Institution - 180, Brugge, 8000, Belgium|Local Institution - 183, Ghent, 9000, Belgium|Local Institution - 184, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|Local Institution - 220, Boulevard, Sofia, 1797, Bulgaria|Local Institution - 221, Plovdiv, 4002, Bulgaria|Local Institution - 262, Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5, Canada|University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2C4, Canada|Local Institution - 263, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|Local Institution - 131, Beijing, Beijing, 100730, China|Local Institution - 135, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, China|Local Institution - 132, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200233, China|Local Institution - 134, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China|Local Institution - 130, Tianjin, Tianjin, 300020, China|Local Institution - 133, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310009, China|Local Institution - 305, Angers, 49033, France|Local Institution - 300, Creteil, 94010, France|Local Institution - 310, La Tronche, 38700, France|Local Institution - 306, Lille, 59037, France|Local Institution - 301, Marseille Cedex 9, 13385, France|Local Institution - 302, Paris, 75010, France|Local Institution - 307, Pessac Cedex, 33604, France|Local Institution - 304, Pierre Benite cedex, 69495, France|Local Institution - 308, Strasbourg, 67091, France|Local Institution - 309, Toulouse Cedex 9, 31059, France|Local Institution - 303, Tours, 37044, France|Local Institution - 341, Berlin, 14195, Germany|Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus an der TU Dresden, Dresden, 01307, Germany|Local Institution - 345, Duesseldorf, 40225, Germany|Local Institution - 346, Dusseldorf, 40479, Germany|Local Institution - 343, Halle, 06120, Germany|Local Institution - 342, Hamburg, 22081, Germany|Local Institution - 344, Hannover, 30625, Germany|Local Institution - 349, Leipzig, 04103, Germany|Local Institution - 340, Mainz, 55131, Germany|Klinikum Rechts der Isar der Technischen Universitaet Muenchen, München, 81675, Germany|Aghia Sophia' Children's General Hospital of Athens, Athens, 115 27, Greece|Laiko General Hospital of Athens - Center of Thalassemia, Athens, 115 27, Greece|Local Institution - 384, Athens, 11527, Greece|Local Institution - 383, Rio Patras, 26500, Greece|General Hospital of Thessaloniki Hippokration, Thessaloniki, 54642, Greece|Local Institution - 425, Afula, 18341, Israel|Rambam Health Corporation, Haifa, 3109601, Israel|Local Institution - 422, Jerusalem, 91031, Israel|Local Institution - 424, Jerusalem, 91120, Israel|Local Institution - 421, Nahariya, 22100, Israel|Local Institution - 423, Petah Tikva, 49100, Israel|Local Institution - 478, Firenze, Toscana, 50134, Italy|Local Institution - 471, Firenze, Toscana, 50139, Italy|Local Institution - 470, Allessandria, 15100, Italy|Local Institution - 464, Bologna, 40138, Italy|Local Institution - 466, Brindisi, 72100, Italy|Local Institution - 477, Cagliari, 09121, Italy|Local Institution - 462, Ferrara, 44124, Italy|Ente Ospedaliero Ospedali Galliera - Centro della Microcitemia e delle Anemie Congenite, Genoa, 16128, Italy|Local Institution - 473, Lecce, 73100, Italy|Maggiore Polyclinic Hospital, IRCCS Ca' Granda, Milano, 20122, Italy|Local Institution - 479, Modena, 41124, Italy|AORN A Cardarelli, Napoli, 80131, Italy|AOU dell'Universita degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Napoli, 80131, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria S.

* To find out if the chance of developing a serious illness or of getting AIDS is less if patients start taking HIV medicines at a time when their cluster-of-differentiation-4 (CD4)+ cell count is still fairly high, instead of waiting until the CD4+ count is at the level where there is good evidence for starting medicines.
* To learn more about how a strategy of starting HIV medicines early might affect other aspects of care, such as the chances of developing other illnesses or resistance to HIV medicines, the frequency of doctor visits, the cost of medical care, and general health and satisfaction.",HIV Infection,DRUG: All licensed antiretroviral medications,University of Minnesota,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)|Copenhagen HIV Programme (CHIP) -- Copenhagen, Denmark|Medical Research Council|Kirby Institute|Washington D.C.
